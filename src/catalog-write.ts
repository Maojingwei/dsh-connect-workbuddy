/**
 * Writing the model's saved directory back to the Host's settings document.
 *
 * THE HOST-SIDE HALF OF ISSUES #114/#115. The card's own save path lives in the
 * browser half (`src/client/`), but the repair that heals a STALE saved
 * directory has to happen where the LIVE roster lands — inside the Host
 * process, right after the upstream answered. So this module writes through
 * the Host's own settings service, using the same merge discipline the
 * browser half uses (see `src/web-status.ts`).
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST WRITE THE WHOLE `regions` FIELD. Because the field holds
 * BOTH regions plus each region's account-pool preferences, and a blind write
 * would drop whatever the user changed in the other region (issue #32's
 * lesson, in a new place). So the write is a MERGE: the region's slot is
 * replaced, every other key of the slot is preserved, and the sibling region
 * is untouched.
 *
 * THE VALUE THIS MODULE WRITES IS THE `regions` FIELD, NOT THE SETTINGS
 * SECTION. That distinction is the whole of this bug — reported as
 * "账号池状态重启就失效". `describe()` hands back the resolved SECTION
 * (`{authFile, accounts, regions, cliBridge, …}`), and
 * `mutate(ns, [{ op: 'set', path: ['regions'], … }])` stores whatever it is
 * given AT that path. Handing it the section therefore wrote the section INTO
 * the field: the real region map was pushed down under a nested `regions` key,
 * its own siblings (`accounts`, `cliBridge`) became fake region slots, and the
 * Host's `regionStateOf(config, 'cn')` — which reads exactly one level — then
 * answered "no slot". Every account-pool preference, model selection and
 * directory looked unsaved after the next restart, and each startup added
 * another level (measured on a live profile: five levels, 258 KB).
 *
 * WHY THE HOST SERVICE RATHER THAN THE SCOPE. The plugin's browser half
 * writes through the Host's settings endpoint because the browser-side
 * `scope.set()` replaces the whole field with the browser's own (possibly
 * stale) mirror — that is documented at `src/client/account-selection.ts`.
 * The same reasoning applies here: there is no browser mirror in the Host
 * process, so the Host's own merge is the only safe writer.

/**
 * Drop one region's PERSISTED account selection, and only if it pinned this
 * account.
 *
 * THE HOST-SIDE HALF OF ISSUE #155'S SECOND REPORT. A user removed one account
 * and the whole CN tab turned into「已保存的账号在本机已不存在」, with no way back:
 * the card's advice points at a list it does not render in that state, so the
 * reporter escaped by hand-posting `{"field":"accounts","value":{"cn":""}}` to
 * the save endpoint. This is that write, made automatic.
 *
 * WHY A WRITE AT ALL — the store already forgets. `removeAccount` clears the
 * in-memory selection, which is why the region keeps working for the rest of the
 * session. But the settings document still names the dead id, so the next
 * `applySelection` — a restart, or any settings save — re-reads it, re-pins it,
 * and the region falls back into the same dead end. An in-memory forget that is
 * never persisted is not a fix; it is a delay.
 *
 * THE DECISION LIVES HERE, WITH THE WRITE, because the two must never be
 * separated by a caller's guess. Clearing a region that did NOT pin this account
 * would move the user off the account they chose, and「换账号等于换人计费」is the
 * rule every writer in this plugin obeys: this function writes for exactly the
 * region whose persisted pin names the account being removed, and no others.
 *
 * WRITES `''`, NEVER A DELETED KEY. The sentinel means "follow the app's current
 * sign-in" — the plugin's documented default, which is what a fresh install does,
 * so this restores a state rather than inventing one. An absent key means "never
 * configured" and falls through to the legacy flat `accountId` (`selectAccountFor`),
 * which would resurrect whichever account that field names: a silent switch
 * through another door. The sentinel also TERMINATES that lookup, which is why one
 * write settles both spellings — a pre-split profile pinned through the flat
 * field is cleared by this same write.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT BY CONTRACT: a service that cannot answer, or a region that pinned
 * nothing, costs no write. The caller logs a failed mutation rather than failing
 * the removal, because the credential file is already gone by then and reporting
 * "could not remove" would be the lie.
 *
 * @param service The Host's settings service, or `undefined` to no-op.
 * @param ns The namespace this plugin's settings live under.
 * @param region The region being checked; the sibling is preserved by the merge.
 * @param accountId The account about to be removed.
 * @param legacyAccountId The deprecated flat `accountId`, as persisted.
 * @param legacyRegion Which region the startup scan attributed that field to.
