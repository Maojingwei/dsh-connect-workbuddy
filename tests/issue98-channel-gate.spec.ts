/**
 * Issue #98: the CN gateway's channel gate, and the two gaps this plugin had
 * in front of it.
 *
 * THE REPORT. The WorkBuddy CN gateway refuses a chat request whose `system`
 * message opens with a known third-party-agent identity — business code
 * `11128`, "Illegal API invocation from an unapproved channel" — and the
 * upstream's own `displayTips` blames the CHANNEL ("可能不是官方客户端发出的"),
 * which sends every reporter to reinstall the official client. Ten people
 * reported it; the plugin already neutralised TWO known fingerprints by
 * prepending "You are a helpful assistant.", so the reports are about the
 * cases that prepend does NOT cover.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED on the live CN gateway on 2026-10-21 (account
 * `ba217455…`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, `max_tokens` 8, every other request
 * field held fixed). These are FACTS, not theory, and every test below is
 * pinned to one of them:
 *
 *   1. The gate scans EVERY `system` message — one placed AFTER a user
 *      message is scanned too, and is refused.
 *   2. When a `system` message's `content` is an ARRAY of parts, the gate
 *      scans EVERY TEXT PART of it: a banned opening in the FIRST part is
 *      refused, and a banned opening in the SECOND part is refused just the
 *      same. (This is GAP A: the plugin's neutraliser only ever looked at
 *      STRING content, so an array-shaped prompt went out on the wire with
 *      the banned opening intact.)
 *   3. Only the START of the content counts — the same sentence mid-content
 *      answers 200.
 *   4. Leading whitespace is trimmed before the comparison — " <banned>" and
 *      "\n<banned>" answer 200.
 *   5. `user` messages are never scanned.
 *   6. The role `developer` is refused on BOTH gateways, which the plugin
 *      already covers by rewriting it to `system` before neutralising.
 *   7. The global gateway does not fingerprint the DSH prompt at all (only
 *      Claude Code); it has a DIFFERENT gate — a body with no system message
 *      is refused with "first message is not system prompt".
 *
 * GAP B is the other half of the issue and it is NOT a guessing game: the
 * gateway's fingerprint list is a SNAPSHOT the upstream can extend at any
 * time, and the plugin cannot see it. So the plugin needs a way to answer
 * "what did we actually send?" ({@link openingEvidenceOfBody}) and a
 * way to build a retry that does not depend on knowing the fingerprint at all
 * ({@link forceNeutralHead}).
