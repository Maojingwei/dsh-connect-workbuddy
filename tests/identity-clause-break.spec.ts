/**
 * The exact-SUBSTRING gate, and the identity-clause break that defends it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM issue98. Issue #98 pinned the PREFIX
 * gate: a scanned message whose text OPENS with a banned identity is refused,
 * and prepending a neutral head moves that opening off offset 0. That defence is
 * real and still runs. But it is the wrong tool for the gate that actually
 * refused the reporter's DSH session, and this file is the evidence for the other
 * one.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT (issue #125, and independently `workbuddy2api-hub` #533 — the
 * latter bisected to the byte on a real 124 KB request):
 *   - the gateway matches a case-insensitive EXACT SUBSTRING ANYWHERE in a
 *     scanned `system`/`assistant` message, not only at the start;
 *   - the live DSH prompt carries THREE such spans, and all three have to be
 *     broken before one request answers 200 — "只改任意一两处不够，三处全改才
 *     200";
 *   - the three spans are the agent's own identity clauses:
 *       You are an AI agent powered by DeepSeek Harness.
 *       You are a coding agent powered by the <model> model.
 *       You are interacting with the user through the DeepSeek Harness Web GUI …
 *
 * WHY THE OLD LADDER COULD NOT REACH SPAN TWO. `perturbChannelFingerprints`'s
 * sparse rung breaks at sentence terminators, CJK terminators, clause commas,
 * and adjacent CAPITALISED word pairs (`WORD_INTERNAL_BREAK`). Span two has
 * none of those inside it: no adjacent capitals ("a coding agent powered by"),
 * no comma, and its terminal full stop lands AFTER the banned substring, so it
 * is not inside the span. Measured against a real prompt: sparse cleared spans
 * one and three and left span two byte-identical — the exact request that kept
 * answering 11128. The dense rung did reach it, but only at +70.7% bytes.
 *
 * THE FIX THIS FILE PINS. Break each identity clause at every INTERNAL word
 * boundary, unconditionally, in `prepareChatBody`. Measured cost on a real
 * 10,818-character DSH system prompt: ~28 added characters (+0.26%), against
 * dense's 7,742 (+70.7%). Cheap enough to run on every request rather than only
 * in a rescue, which is the whole point — a rescue has to be refused first.
